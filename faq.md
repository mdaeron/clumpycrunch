### Can ClumpyCrunch help me reprocess old Δ~47~ measurements in a new reference frame?

Yes, in some cases. For instance, let's suppose you have a dataset with several sessions including analyses of heated/equilibrated gases, carbonate standards, and unknwons samples. In order to reprocess these data in a new reference frame anchored to carbonate standards, you may enter the nominal values of these new carbonate standard in the “Standardization Settings” text box, and rename all your heated/equilibrated gases so that all gases equilibrated at the same temperature are named as a single unknown sample, e.g., `HG`, `EG-25`... Using the pooled standardization approach will ensure that the gas analyses are fully used to constrain the compositional/gas slope, while still anchoring the final, absolute Δ~47~ values to the carbonate standards specified in the standardization settings.

For this approach to succeed the follwoing conditions must be met:

1. each of your sessions must include at least one carbonate anchor;
2. at least one session must include two or more carbonate anchors covering a large range of Δ~47~ values;
3. each session must include gases and/or carbonate standards covering a wide range of δ~47~ values.
